# Project-R1
Interactive Electronic Configuration Model
This is to assemble the bare bones from modelling to
function layout, and them to defining programming structures
and eventually to functioning program modules that can
be inserted into the structure to form the eventual Project-R1.

Available hardware includes:

1 x RaspberryPi 3 b+
1 x MATRIX Voice developers kit, IOT, Voice recognition
1 x Arduino Expansion Shield

The eventual aim is to create a droid capable of following verbal
commands, and responding with both physical and verbal output, 
as well as being able to communicate with other electronic devices.
